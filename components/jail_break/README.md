# JailBreak Component

## 1. Component Name
JailBreak

## 2. Description
The JailBreak component is part of the Yeager Workflow and is designed to process search queries and return final results within the workflow.

## 3. Input and Output Models
### Input Model
`JailBreakIn`:
- search_query (str): A search query to be processed by the JailBreak component.

### Output Model
`JailBreakOut`:
- final_result (List[Dict]): The processed final_result of the search query.

Both input and output models use Pydantic for validation and serialization.

## 4. Parameters
- args (JailBreakIn): The input model containing the search query to be processed.
- callbacks (typing.Any): Additional callbacks passed to the transform method if needed.

## 5. Transform Function
The `transform()` method in the JailBreak component follows these steps:

1. It calls the `transform()` method in the parent class (AbstractWorkflow) with the provided `args` and `callbacks`. This returns a dictionary called `results_dict`.
2. Process the `results_dict` to create the `final_result`. This exact logic depends on the requirements and may need to be modified accordingly.
3. Creates an instance of the `JailBreakOut` output model with the `final_result`.
4. Returns the `JailBreakOut` instance containing the processed final_result.

## 6. External Dependencies
- typing: For specifying types such as List and Dict.
- dotenv: For environment configuration management.
- fastapi: For creating an instance of the FastAPI application.
- pydantic: For creating input and output models and handling validation and serialization.

## 7. API Calls
There are no direct external API calls made by the component within the provided source code. However, the component allows for the possibility of adding API calls if needed when processing the `results_dict` step of the `transform()` method.

## 8. Error Handling
Error handling in the JailBreak component is derived from the underlying Pydantic validation and serialization for input and output models, FastAPI default error handling capabilities, and any errors raised within the parent class (AbstractWorkflow).

## 9. Examples
To use the JailBreak component within a Yeager Workflow, you can follow these steps:

1. Instantiate the input model with a search query:
